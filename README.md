# TSP-Project2
Performs BFS/DFS based on a pre-given graph of connected edges.  
This function hard codes the graph based on the given assignment in the pdf, '2TSP_DFS_BFS.docx'.

Example Call:
`[ distMin, weightedPath, unweightedPath, visualizeParams ] = TSP('11PointDFSBFS.tsp');`

Stores distance, two graphs, and the parameters used to visualize those graphs. Check workspace after running for details.
